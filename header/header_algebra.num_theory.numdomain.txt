Number Structures: Orders and Norms in Algebraic Hierarchies
============================================================

Overview
--------
This file establishes a foundational framework for ordered and normed algebraic structures within the Mathematical Components ecosystem using Coq. Its primary goal is to formalize and interconnect several classes of "number structures"—algebraic structures (such as modules and rings) equipped with an order and a norm—culminating in robust definitions of *ordered domains with norm* and *real domains*. By introducing type classes, canonical structures, and a large suite of basic and advanced lemmas, this module supports systematic development and automated reasoning over inequalities, norms, sign functions, and real predicates in abstract algebraic settings.

Unlike files focusing solely on a particular numeric type (like integers or real numbers), this file develops a generic, type-driven hierarchy that abstracts over the specific nature of the elements, provided the relevant algebraic and order-theoretic properties are present. It serves as the backbone for reasoning about inequalities, triangle-type inequalities, sign manipulations, and absolute value-based arguments for arbitrary structures including, but not limited to, real number systems.

Mathematical Structures and Their Representations
-------------------------------------------------
### 1. **Semi-Normed and Normed Module Types**
- **semiNormedZmodType**: Represents a *commutative group (Z-module) with a semi-norm*. Here, a *semi-norm* is a non-negative, subadditive function (satisfying `||x+y|| ≤ ||x|| + ||y||`, homogeneous under natural number multiplication, and symmetric with respect to sign). The norm's codomain is itself required to be an *ordered abelian group* (captured by `POrderedZmodule.type`).
- **normedZmodType**: Extends `semiNormedZmodType` with the *positive-definiteness* property (`||x|| = 0` iff `x = 0`). These two classes are realized as HB structures (Hierachical Builder patterns): `SemiNormedZmodule` and `NormedZmodule`, respectively.

### 2. **Number Domains with Norms and Orders**
- **numDomainType**: Encapsulates an *integral domain* equipped with both an order and a norm (`NumDomain`). The order is required to be compatible with the ring operations, and the norm must be multiplicative and respect the triangle inequality.

### 3. **Real Domains**
- **realDomainType**: Represents a `numDomainType` with a *total order* ("real field"). This is formally captured via the `Order.Total` property for the ring's order.

### 4. **Sign and Real Predicates**
- **num.sg**: The sign function (here called `sg` or `sgr`) assigns each element its sign: `0` if zero, `1` if positive, and `-1` if negative.
- **Real predicates**: Several tagged predicates are defined on elements to indicate positivity, non-negativity, reality, etc. These are implemented through generic setoid predicates, usually named as `pos`, `nneg`, `real`, etc.

### 5. **Operations and Morphisms**
- All of addition, multiplication, subtraction, and inversion are developed alongside the order and norm. Specific attention is given to properties like the triangle inequality, submultiplicativity, monotonicity, and compatibility between operations, order, and norms.

Key Coding and Notational Conventions
-------------------------------------
1. **Short and Long Notations**:
   - Short forms, like `normr` for the norm (`norm`), or `sg` for the sign function, are introduced for convenience.
   - The more verbose qualified forms (`Num.sg`, `Num.norm`) are also available and preferred in theory development.
   - For brevity in interactive proofs, users can `Import Num.Def.` or `Num.Theory.` to bring short notations and main lemmas into scope.

2. **Infix and Symbolic Syntax**:
   - The absolute value is denoted as `` `|x|``, as in the mathematical tradition.
   - Orders use `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`, and set-theoretic predicates like `\is real`.
   - Products, sums, and big operators (`\sum_`, `\prod_`) follow standard MathComp conventions over sequences and finite types.

3. **Prefixes and Predicate Naming**:
   - The code employs a family of prefixes for properties: `p` (positive), `n` (negative), `sp` (strictly positive), `i` (interior, i.e., in `[0,1]`), `e` (exterior, i.e., in `[1,∞)`), `w` (weak, i.e., non-strict).
   - Real predicates such as `\is nneg` or `\is real` are "reflected"—that is, they bridge the gap between set-theoretic and boolean reasoning.

4. **Canonical Hierarchy via HB (Hierarchical Builders)**:
   - The file uses HB to define, extend, and relate all the relevant classes and mixins needed to layer order and norm structure on rings and modules.
   - Construction "factory" records enable the smooth transfer of properties and structure.

5. **Scopes and Imports**:
   - Several local scopes (`order_scope`, `group_scope`, `ring_scope`) are used to manage overloaded notations and prevent ambiguity.
   - `Import` statements bring in theory and structure from base modules such as `ssrAC`, `order`, `ssralg`, and others.

6. **Reflect and Boolean Equalities**:
   - Many order, sign, and norm operations are paired with reflect lemmas, making it possible to reason equivalently in existential, propositional, and boolean forms.
   - Conditional notations and lemmas, for instance, `?= iff`, appear throughout to encapsulate equivalences useful in constructive mathematics.

7. **Monotony and Morphism Properties**:
   - The file provides "monotone" and "homomorphism" notation for functions monotone with respect to orders, supporting local and in-predicate monotonicity for advanced rewriting.

Organization and Usage
---------------------
- **Hierarchy Construction**: The file begins by formally defining the core mixins for semi-normed and normed modules, using them to recursively build up more complex structures (numeric domains, real domains).
- **Quantified Properties**: Extension axioms for realness, archimedean property, and real-closure are set out as formal properties.
- **Core Lemmas**: Dozens of lemmas and definitions provide elementary and advanced properties about norms, orders, sign functions, monotonicity, min/max, and more. These facilitate formal reasoning in subsequent algebraic theory developments.
- **Predicate Closures**: Proofs that real, nonnegative, positive, etc. sets are closed under certain operations (addition, multiplication, inversion, etc.) are provided for easy set-level reasoning.
- **Hint Database**: Standard hints for orders, norms, and real predicates accelerate proof scripts through automatic tactic application.
- **Specialized Lemmas**: The theory, especially for real domains, supports arguments around inequalities, mean value inequalities, polynomial bounds, and conditional inequalities.

Intended Role and Audience
--------------------------
This file is designed for mathematicians and formal methodologists working in Coq who wish to leverage or extend an abstract, type-driven systematization of algebraic order and norm. It allows one to:
  - Work generically with modules, rings, and domains equipped with real-like order and norm structure.
  - Prove (or automate the proof of) statements about inequalities, realness, and norm estimates across disparate types.
  - Build extensions, such as real closed fields, archimedean structures, or specialized normed modules, using a rich library of canonical definitions and theorems.

By reviewing this docstring, a reader gains a broad understanding of the structures defined, the conventions in place, and the kinds of results available—enabling detailed navigation and precise interpretation of individual code segments within the file.

* Group-like Structures: Algebraic Foundations and Morphisms in Coq
*******************************************************************************

Overview
========
This file formalizes the hierarchy of basic group-like algebraic structures within the Coq proof assistant. Its primary goal is to provide general, reusable, and foundational definitions, notations, and morphism frameworks for magmas, semigroups, monoids, groups, and their key substructures. It is designed to support rigorous formal reasoning about abstract algebra in the MathComp ecosystem, while enabling smooth interoperability between structural classes (e.g., for "subgroups," direct products, and function spaces) through a combination of canonical structures and theory sections. The file is written to be as generic as possible, extending to types equipped with discrete (choice) structure, and with explicit handling of morphisms and closure properties.

Key Mathematical Structures and Representations
===============================================
1. **Magma (`magmaType`)**
   - **Mathematical essence**: A set equipped with a binary operation (*), possibly non-associative.
   - **Coq representation**: Records a carrier type `G` and a binary operation `mul : G -> G -> G`, via the HB (Hierarchy Builder) infrastructure.
   - **Notation**: `x * y`

2. **Semigroup (`semigroupType`)**
   - **Definition**: A magma whose multiplication is associative.
   - **Coq extension**: Requires associativity (`mulgA`).
  
3. **(Pointed) Magmas, Unitary Magmas, Monoids**
   - **Base U-Magma (`baseUMagmaType`)**: A magma with a distinguished element (`one`), without requiring associativity or unit laws.
   - **UMagma (`umagmaType`)**: A base U-magma in which the unit acts as a left and right identity.
   - **Monoid (`monoidType`)**: An associative UMagma; combines associativity and the unit laws.

4. **Groups (`groupType`) and Base Groups**
   - **Base Group (`baseGroupType`)**: A base U-magma with an inversion operation (`inv : G -> G`).
   - **Group (`groupType`)**: A monoid where every element has an inverse; combines associativity, unit, and invertibility.
   - **Additional operations and forms**: division (`x / y := x * y^-1`), exponentiation (`x ^+ n` for n ≥ 0, `x ^- n` for negative powers), conjugation (`x ^ y := y^-1 * (x * y)`), and commutators (`[~ x, y ] := x^-1 * y^-1 * (x * y)`).

5. **Substructures**
   - **SubMagma, SubSemigroup, SubUMagma, SubMonoid, SubGroup**: Subtypes of group-like structures corresponding to subsets stable under the relevant operations (closure), implemented with canonical subtypes and associated proofs that the operations restrict to the subset.

6. **Morphisms (Structure-Preserving Maps)**
   - **`Multiplicative`**: Functions between magmas that respect the multiplication.
   - **`UMagmaMorphism`**: Functions between UMagma structures that respect both multiplication and the unit.
   - **Group morphisms**: Maps respecting group operations (including inversion and division), unified within the HB system.

7. **Predicate-Based Closure Structures**
   - **`mulgClosed`, `umagmaClosed`, `invgClosed`, and `groupClosed`**: Predicates on subsets of a group-like type, packaged as structures with supporting properties and lemmas to systematize closure under the relevant operations.

8. **Product and Function Spaces**
   - **Direct product**: Structure instances on pairs `(G * H)`, inheriting operations pointwise.
   - **Function space**: Structure instances on types `T -> G` (including finite function spaces `{ffun aT -> rT}`), via pointwise binary operations and units.

Fundamental Notations and Coding Conventions
============================================

- ***Notation system and scopes:***
  - The main notations for group-like operations (`*`, `1`, `^-1`, `/`, `^+ n`, etc.) are defined in the `group_scope` (delimited by `%g`).
  - Custom notations for iterated products (e.g., `\prod_(i <- r | P) F`) extend standard big operator syntax; these act over structures with a unit element.
  - Function and morphism notations use special syntax (e.g., `{multiplicative G -> H}` for magma morphisms, `f \* g` for pointwise product).

- ***Naming conventions:***
  - Structure types representing algebraic objects follow the `XType` pattern (e.g., `magmaType`, `groupType`) and their subtypes as `subXType`.
  - Mixins (recording the core operations and laws) use the pattern `hasX`, `isX`, `X_isY`, etc.
  - Suffixes in lemma names denote the involved structure and operation:
    - `M` (multiplication), `1` (unity), `V` (inverse), `F` (division), `X` (exponentiation), `J` (conjugation), `R` (commutator), often combined with n (as in `expgMn`) or D/B/X for compounded operators.

- ***Implicit arguments and binding:***
  - The file uses `Set Implicit Arguments` to reduce verbosity.
  - Carrier types of algebraic structures are bound to the relevant scopes to ensure notational correctness.

- ***Sectioning and modular construction:***
  - Each structure/class receives a dedicated Coq `Section` containing definitions and standard lemmas ("theory").
  - Factories and builder sections implement the "mixin" approach: structure is developed in small verifiable record chunks, then composed into the main type.
  - Morphism theory sections generalize standard group-theoretic constructions to the morphism interfaces.

- ***Substructure construction:***
  - Substructure types are parametrized by a predicate `P : pred G`, equipped (via mixins) with proofs that the operations restrict to the subset.
  - The `val` function embeds elements of the substructure into the ambient structure, proven to respect all relevant operations.

Use and Context
===============
This file plays a foundational role in MathComp-style algebra, providing a standard vocabulary and reusable infrastructure for reasoning about arbitrary group-theoretic and monoid-theoretic phenomena in Coq. Its design supports formal development of further algebraic concepts (such as rings, fields, or modules) by giving both a flexible universe of group-like structures and a robust system for working with subobjects and morphisms.

For commenting or interpreting specific code pieces in this file, apply the following principles:
- Identify which algebraic structure(s) are in play (magma, group, etc.) and note which mixins/code blocks package the syntax and required axioms.
- Morphisms are universally handled as record types over functions, recorded with preservation properties—in proofs, focus on how the function respects the relevant operations.
- Closure-related code corresponds to encapsulated predicates over subsets, permitting abstract arguments about subgroups/submonoids, etc.
- Notational conventions and scope management are key in recognizing how operations and expressions are intended to be parsed and interpreted.
- Reasoning about properties (associativity, inverse, closure, etc.) uses a tightly organized system of records/factories/builders, consistently mirroring algebraic definitions.

The content is designed to be reused, extended, and imported by later files developing more complex algebraic or order-theoretic structures.

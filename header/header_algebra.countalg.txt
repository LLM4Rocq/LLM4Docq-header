Countable Algebraic Structures

Overview
========
This Coq source file extends MathComp’s algebraic hierarchy to cover **countable algebraic structures**. Its main objective is to provide formal interfaces—types, typeclasses, and associated notations—for algebraic objects such as modules, rings, semirings, fields, and their variants, all equipped with a **countable structure** (i.e., for which there exists an enumeration without repetition). This is essential for developments that require constructive choice, probabilistic methods, or effective enumeration within algebraic contexts, while maintaining compatibility with the established MathComp algebraic hierarchy.

Specifically, the file introduces "countable" analogues of core algebraic structures from MathComp's `ssralg` library. This is achieved by defining *countable extensions* of structures such as (semi)rings, (semi)modules, unit rings, fields, etc., and by organizing these as HB (Hierarchy Builder) structures in the MathComp hierarchy system. The file carefully arranges these interfaces for modular reuse, future extensions, and for ensuring smooth interaction with other countable constructions in MathComp and user code.

Mathematical Objects and Their Coq Representations
=================================================
The following is a summary of the principal mathematical structures addressed, and how they are encoded:

1. **Countable Types (`Countable`)**:
   - A set `T` is *countable* if there is a bijection with a subset of the natural numbers with no repetitions. In Coq/MathComp, this is encoded via the `Countable` typeclass/interface.
   - All algebraic structures considered here require their carrier type to be countable.

2. **Algebraic Structures** (all equipped with a countable carrier):
   - **Additive Modules:**
     - `Nmodule`: Near-modules (modules without necessarily a zero element).
     - `Zmodule`: Additive abelian groups (modules over the integers, i.e., additive commutative groups).
   - **Semirings and Rings:**
     - `PzSemiRing` and `NzSemiRing`: Partial/Nontrivial semirings.
     - `PzRing` and `NzRing`: Partial/Nontrivial rings.
     - *Partial* types refer to potentially degenerate objects (e.g., possibly lacking a multiplicative identity), while *nontrivial* requires nondegeneracy.
   - **Commutativity:**
     - Commutative variants of the above (`ComPzSemiRing`, `ComNzSemiRing`, `ComPzRing`, `ComNzRing`): The multiplication operation is commutative.
   - **Unit Rings and Fields:**
     - `UnitRing`, `ComUnitRing`: (Commutative) rings with units (multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements).
     - `IntegralDomain`: Commutative rings with no zero divisors (domains).
     - `Field`, `DecidableField`, `ClosedField`: Standard field notions (not necessarily algebraically closed, but possibly with extra decision or closure properties).
   - **Algebraic Closure and Extensions:**
     - While not implemented directly in this file, the documenting comment indicates that general constructions such as algebraic closure and simple field extensions for countable fields are available or facilitated by these interfaces.

Each structure, say `CountRing.X`, is implemented as an HB interface combining the standard MathComp algebraic structure (`GRing.X`) with the `Countable` interface, represented as `{T of GRing.X T & Countable T}`. These interfaces are systematically named (see conventions below).

Key Conventions and Notational Guidelines
=========================================
- **Naming Scheme:**
  - Each countable-structure interface follows the pattern `CountRing.X`, where `X` is the name of the standard MathComp algebraic structure (e.g., `Zmodule`, `NzRing`, `UnitRing`, `Field`).
  - The `#[short(type="countXType")]` attribute creates the corresponding short type-level name (e.g., `countZmodType` for a countable additive group).
  - Deprecated legacy names (pre MathComp 2.4.0) are provided as notations (e.g., `countRingType`) for backward compatibility, but new developments should use the new names.

- **Module Organization:**
  - The core of the file is the `CountRing` module, which contains all the structure definitions.
  - Modules named `Ring`, `SemiRing`, `ComRing`, `ComSemiRing` provide synonyms for backward compatibility and are marked as deprecated.
  - The `ReguralExports` (note: likely a typo for "RegularExports") submodule ensures that certain canonical instances are exported (e.g., for the "opposite" types, denoted as `R^o`).

- **HB/HB.structure Usage:**
  - Structures use the HB (Hierarchy Builder) mechanism for interface composition and inheritance.
  - Each structure is defined via `HB.structure` as a combination (`{T of ... & ...}`) of the algebraic property (`GRing.X`) and countability (`Countable`).

- **Typeclass Interplay and Canonical Instances:**
  - Canonical instances are provided so that, e.g., the "opposite" ring of a countable ring is again a countable ring.
  - Notations like `sort`, `on`, `copy` for structures follow MathComp conventions.

- **Scope, Implicit Arguments, and Imports:**
  - The file sets `Implicit Arguments` and disables strictness/defensive printing, standard in MathComp developments.
  - The module imports and reexports structure and algebraic theory modules from MathComp (`ssralg`) but restricts itself to adapting structure, not proving new theorems.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Users of this file can use, for example, `countRingType` to refer to a countable ring (with the current preferred usage being `CountRing.NzRing` or its associated short type).
  - Backward compatibility is provided for older notation via deprecated aliases.

- **Coverage and Extension:**
  - This file does *not* cover left modules or algebra interfaces; only the structures listed in the overview comment are present.
  - The design allows for the extension of both the algebraic and countability structure independently and together.

Context and Usage Recommendations
=================================
This file is intended as an infrastructure component: it should be imported when formalizing algebraic objects—rings, fields, modules, etc.—and proofs that require *explicit enumerability* of elements. Such situations arise frequently in constructive mathematics, algorithmic algebra, probability on algebraic structures, or computable mathematics in general. The file establishes the basic interfaces, naming conventions, and canonical structure support so that further code (definitions, theorems, algorithms) depending on countable algebraic structures can be formulated precisely, modularly, and in harmony with the broader MathComp algebraic hierarchy. 

It is suitable for users wishing to:
  - Formulate or use algebraic structures with enumeration or computability requirements.
  - Leverage MathComp tactics, notations, and inheritance mechanisms on countable types.
  - Transition or maintain code in the context of the evolving MathComp algebra hierarchy.

The file does not prove algebraic facts about countable types nor implement algorithms for enumeration or closure, but rather serves as the definitional backbone allowing other files to do so.

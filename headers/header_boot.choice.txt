Types with Choice and Countable Structures

Overview
========
This file defines and develops interfaces and constructions for types equipped with "choice" and "countable" structures within the Coq proof assistant. Its primary purpose is to formalize the notion of types that support:

1. **Choice operators**: Constructively picking an element satisfying a decidable predicate, whenever such an element exists.
2. **Countability**: Effectively encoding elements as natural numbers, supporting serialization and partial inverses.

These concepts enable a uniform, constructive treatment of existential quantification and type encoding in formalized mathematics, providing bridges between constructive logic, computable mathematics, and code extraction.

The file also lays the technical groundwork for propagating these structures through standard type formers (e.g., products, sums, options, sequences, and subtypes)—that is, ensuring that if component types have choice or countable structure, so do their composites. Some generic datatypes, notably n-ary trees, are furnished with these interfaces as universal encodings.

Mathematical Objects and Representations
=======================================

The file introduces several major abstractions and their realizations in Coq:

**1. Choice Types (`choiceType`, class `Choice`)**
---------------------------------------------------
A *choice type* is a type (with decidable equality) for which there exists an operator to select, in a constructive way, an element satisfying a predicate `P : T → bool`, given a proof that `∃ x, P x`. The main operations are:

- `xchoose`: Given a proof that `∃ x, P x`, returns a canonical `x` such that `P x` holds.
- `choose`: Given predicate `P` and a default element `x0`, returns a canonical `x` such that `P x` if `P x0` holds, otherwise just returns `x0`.

Both operations are *extensional*: their values do not depend on the particular proof object, but only on the predicate's extension.

The Choice interface centers around an internal operator (`find_subdef`) which tries to locate an element of the type satisfying the predicate by a bounded search indexed by naturals (`nat`).

**2. Countable Types (`countType`, class `Countable`)**
--------------------------------------------------------
A *countable type* is a type with a choice structure (i.e., it is also a choiceType), plus an injective, computable, and (partially) invertible encoding to the natural numbers (`nat`). This is formalized by supplying:

- `pickle: T → nat`: encodes an element as a natural number.
- `unpickle: nat → option T`: partial inverse, with `unpickle (pickle x) = Some x` (possibly for all or some `x`).
- `pickle_inv: nat → option T`: a more precise inverse, satisfying `pickle_inv n = Some x` if and only if `pickle x = n`.

These operations make precise the notion of "serializable" types, with effective procedures for encoding and recovery.

**3. Substructure Types**
-------------------------
- `subChoiceType`, `subCountType`: Interfaces for subtypes that inherit choice and countable structures from their parent types, guaranteeing coherent propagation through subset types (e.g., record types `{x : T | P x}`).

**4. Factories and Canonical Builders**
---------------------------------------
Key canonical mechanisms provide machinery to build choice and countable structures for new types based on existing types and cancellation properties, including:
- `PCanIsCountable`, `CanIsCountable`: Factories for constructing countable instances from partial/cancellation functions relating new and old types.
- Choice/Countable structures for dependent pairs (`{i : I & T i}`), options, sums, products, sequences, and generic trees, by reducing to or encoding via existing structures.

**5. Generic n-ary Trees (`GenTree.tree`)**
--------------------------------------------
A universal tree datatype, parameterized by a label type `T`, with leaves labeled by `T` and nodes labeled by nats (with arbitrary arity). Provides eqType, choiceType, and countType structures, serving as a generic encoding target for other inductive datatypes.

**6. Sequence Codings (`CodeSeq.code`, etc.)**
------------------------------------------------
Gödelesque one-to-one encoding between finite sequences of natural numbers and single naturals, supporting the automatable (de-)serialization of lists.

Key Conventions and Notational Details
======================================
- **Canonical Structures and Inference**: The file relies heavily on HB (Hierarchy Builder, an extension of MathComp), Canonical Structures, and HB factories to facilitate automated inference and propagation of choice and countable structures through type constructors and subtype mechanisms.
- **Predicates as bool-valued**: Predicates to be used with choice functions are given as boolean-valued functions `pred T`, enabling their use in constructive search.
- **Partial and Total Cancellations**: Various interfaces exploit (partial or total) cancellative functions to transfer countable/choice structures between types (`pcancel`: partial cancellation, `cancel`: total bijection).
- **Naming Conventions**: Suffixes like `HasChoice`/`isCountable` are used for mixins, `Copy` for canonical cloning, `of T by <:` for subtypes, and abbreviations like `PCan`/`Can` for (partial) cancellation.
- **Implicit Arguments and Scopes**: Arguments are carefully managed implicitly. Some aliases employ the `[Choice of ...]` and `[Countable of ...]` scopes, matching MathComp standards.
- **Boilerplate Automation**: Techniques are provided to instantiate choice/countable structures automatically for standard types and composites, including `unit`, `bool`, `void`, options, products, sums, sequences, subtypes, and generic trees.

Context for Retrieval and Structure Navigation
==============================================

- **Purpose and Use**: This file serves as the foundational layer for constructing and reasoning about types equipped with effective witnesses (choice) and encodings (countability). It is required by further developments within the framework (“Mathematical Components”) that rely on constructive existence and enumeration.
- **Locality**: All crucial concepts are *self-contained*: the file provides their definitions, constructions, and basic theorems, including instances for standard types.
- **Lookup and Attribution**: Any symbol such as `choiceType`, `countType`, `xchoose`, `pickle`, `GenTree.tree`, or factories like `PCanIsCountable` can be interpreted within this context as either an interface, method, instance, or constructor as described above.
- **Extensibility**: To endow a new type with choice or countable structure, one can provide an appropriate encoding/cancellation to an existing countable type (usually `nat` or combinations thereof), and then use the canonical builders and factories defined herein.

Summary
=======
In sum, this file systematically characterizes the landscape of types with constructive choice and encoding properties, equips standard and composite Coq types with these features, and supplies both canonical means for extension and the combinatorial machinery to maintain these properties through standard type operators. Its conventions and operators are central for future work involving constructive existence proofs, generic programming, and computable mathematics in large formal developments.

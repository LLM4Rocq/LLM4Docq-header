Extraspecial p-Groups: Fine Structure and Canonical Constructions

Overview and Purpose
====================
This file formalizes the fine structure theory of extraspecial p-groups within a constructive framework, using the Mathematical Components (MathComp) library for finite group theory in Coq. The primary objective is to provide canonical definitions, explicit constructions, and structural theorems for extraspecial groups of prime power order, particularly those arising in the classification of finite simple groups. The file both establishes existence and uniqueness results—closely following Aschbacher’s "Finite Group Theory", section 23—and provides concrete canonical models for these group classes. Together with related files on maximal and extremal subgroups, this module completes the formal study of non-abelian p-groups with a cyclic maximal subgroup.

Mathematical Objects and Concepts
=================================
**Key mathematical structures treated in this file include:**

1. **Extraspecial p-Groups**: These are non-abelian p-groups (groups in which the order of every element is a power of a prime p) whose center, derived subgroup, and Frattini subgroup all coincide and are of order p, and whose quotient by the center is an elementary abelian group of rank 2n. Canonically, there is—up to isomorphism—a unique extraspecial group of order p^{1+2n} and exponent p or 4, for any n > 0.

2. **Canonical Group Constructions**: The file defines and constructs canonical representatives of the classes of extraspecial groups, as well as several well-known 2-groups:
   - `'Mod_m` : The modular group of order m = p^n (n ≥ 3, p prime).
   - `'D_m`   : The dihedral group of order m = 2n (n ≥ 2).
   - `'Q_m`   : The (generalized) quaternion group of order m = 2^n (n ≥ 3).
   - `'SD_m`  : The semi-dihedral group of order m = 2^n (n ≥ 4).

3. **Central Products and Iterated Constructions:**
   - `"p^{1+2}"` : The "basic" extraspecial group of order p^3, constructed explicitly; for p = 2, it coincides with `'D_8` (dihedral group of order 8), while for odd primes p it is a non-Modular group of exponent p.
   - `"p^{1+2*n}"` : The iterated central (extraspecial) product of n copies of `"p^{1+2}"`, yielding a group of order p^{1+2n}. For p = 2, an alternative notation is used for convenience and tradition (`'D^n`).
   - `"'D^n"` : The central product of n copies of `'D_8` (for p = 2).
   - `"'D^n * 'Q'"` : The central product of `"'D^n"` with `'Q_8`, representing all extraspecial 2-groups of order 2^{2n+3} that are not central products of only `'D_8` copies.

4. **Group Properties and Invariants:**
   - **p-groups**: Groups where every element's order is a power of p.
   - **Exponent**: The least common multiple of the orders of all elements in the group.
   - **Group Rank**: The minimal number of generators; typically, `'r_p(G)` denotes the p-rank of G.
   - **Group Isomorphism and Structure Constants**: Explicit presentation of isomorphisms, structure constants, and central product decompositions.

**Representation in Coq:**
- All groups are represented as types of `finGroupType`, finite group types from MathComp.
- Elements of groups are taken from group sorts (denoted via `gsort`).
- Central products and group actions use MathComp’s `GroupAction`, `sdprod_groupType`, and various product types (e.g., `xcprod` for external central products).
- Properties like `extraspecial`, `p.-group`, and `exponent` are formalized as predicates and invariants on these structures.

Key Notational and Coding Conventions
=====================================
1. **Named Notations and Hidden Scopes:**
   - Notations such as `"p^{1+2}"`, `"p^{1+2*n}"`, `"'D^n"`, and `"'D^n * 'Q'"` are reserved and overloaded across three scopes: 
     - `%type` (the group’s type),
     - `%g` (the set of its elements),
     - `%G` (the group as a subgroup of itself in MathComp’s sense).
   - Depending on context, the same notation may refer to a group type, group set, or group value—disambiguated by scope.

2. **Reserved Syntax and Precedence:**
   - Notation like `"n %:R"` (for coercing a nat to a ring element) and formulas for group powers are used.
   - Explicit Coq `Reserved Notation` statements at the start help avoid ambiguities and document intended notation.

3. **Modularity via Sections and Modules:**
   - Core constructions are encapsulated in local modules (`Pextraspecial`) and sections, facilitating reusability and clear parameterization over `p`, `n`, etc.

4. **Abstraction Over Primes and Natural Numbers:**
   - Variables such as `p : nat` represent arbitrary primes; results are stated and proved for all such p, with appropriate prime hypotheses.
   - Group orders typically appear as explicit functions of `p` and `n`, e.g., `p^{1+2*n}`.

5. **Action and Product Structures:**
   - Group actions are registered using canonical structures (`Action`, `GroupAction`).
   - Central products are created via iterated external central product constructions, using MathComp’s `xcprod`, `ncprod`, etc.

6. **Lemmas and Theorems:**
   - Main lemmas prove cardinalities, p-group properties, exponents, extraspecial nature, group isomorphism classification, unique decomposition into products, and invariants such as rank.
   - Results often parallel or directly formalize explicit steps/theorems from Aschbacher’s book.

File Structure and Interpretation Guidance
=========================================
- The file alternates between formal group-theoretic constructions (canonical models, explicit products, group actions) and abstract structural theorems (existence, classification, isomorphism criteria) for extraspecial groups.
- When code refers to a notation like `"p^{1+2*n}"`, recognize it as a formal representative of the unique extraspecial group of order p^{1+2n}, given explicitly as the n-fold central product of `"p^{1+2}"`.
- Structural lemmas characterize when a given group (by order, exponent, and extraspecial property) is isomorphic to one of these canonical constructions.
- For p = 2, additional cases (dihedral, quaternion, semi-dihedral) are treated in depth and in parallel, with dedicated proof lemmas and notational conventions.
- Scopes and modules are used extensively: always interpret notations in the right scope (`%type`, `%g`, `%G`) to distinguish between types, sets, and group elements.

Summary
=======
This module serves as the canonical reference for the combinatorial and constructive theory of extraspecial p-groups in Coq. It offers both classical structural results (order, exponent, uniqueness) and explicit canonical models, under a robust notation and abstraction layer. To understand or extend any portion of the file, always consider (1) the precise group-theoretic structure and invariants represented, (2) the notational conventions specifying group type versus set versus subgroup, and (3) the typified use of MathComp’s finite group formalization idioms.

Prime Decomposition in Finite Group Theory

Overview
========
This file provides a comprehensive formalization of group-theoretic notions in finite group theory that are derived from the prime decomposition of the orders of groups and their elements. Its main objective is to define, relate, and develop properties of structures such as π-groups and their subgroups, Hall and Sylow subgroups, elements of specified order, and the various “core” constructions induced by sets of primes. The formalization is intended for use in rigorous, computer-checked mathematics with the Coq proof assistant, utilizing the Mathematical Components (MathComp) framework’s approach to finite group theory.

Mathematical Objects and Concepts
=================================
The central mathematical objects and definitions manipulated in this file are:

• **Prime Sets and Predicates (π):**
  - A set of prime numbers, usually denoted `pi : nat_pred`, representing the collection of primes under consideration. 
  - The prime complement `pi'` is the set of all primes not in `pi`.
  - When `pi` is just a single prime `{p}`, specialized concepts recover the usual p-group language.

• **Finite Groups and Subgroups:**
  - Finite groups are represented by Coq’s `{group gT}` types for some `finGroupType gT`.
  - Subgroups (as sets) are `{set gT}` or more specifically `{group gT}`.

• **π-Groups and p-Groups:**
  - A *π-group* is a group whose order is a π-number; that is, a group whose (finite) order is divisible only by primes in π.
    - Coq: `pi.-group G` is defined as `pi.-nat #|G|`.
  - A *p-group* is a special case for a singleton π, i.e., π = {p}.

• **π-Subgroups:**
  - A subgroup H of G that is itself a π-group and contained in G.
    - Coq: `pi.-subgroup(G) H := (H ⊆ G) && pi.-group H`.

• **Hall π-Subgroups and Sylow p-Subgroups:**
  - *Hall π-subgroup*: a subgroup H of G such that |H| is a π-number and its index is coprime to all primes in π (`pi'.-nat #|G : H|`).
    - Coq: `pi.-Hall(G) H`.
  - *Sylow p-subgroup*: the case π = {p}; preferred input and notational conventions use `p.-Sylow(G) P`. The set of all p-Sylow subgroups is denoted `'Syl_p(G)`.

• **Elements of π-Order (π-Elements):**
  - An element x is a π-element if its order is a π-number (`pi.-nat #[x]`). 
    - Coq: `pi.-elt x`.

• **Constituent Elements (`x._pi`):**
  - For x in G, `x._pi` denotes the unique π-element in the cyclic subgroup generated by x, such that x times its inverse is a π'-element.
  - This is a canonical decomposition into a commuting product of a π-element and a π'-element.

• **Core and Series Constructions:**
  - *π-Core* `'O_pi(G)`: the largest normal π-subgroup of G, obtained as the intersection of all maximal π-subgroups of G.
  - *π-cores modulo H* and *series of cores*: iterated constructions for sequences of prime sets.
  - *pseries*: generalized core series for a sequence of π’s; notation `'O_{p1, ..., pn}(G)`.

• **Homomorphisms, Quotients, and Series:**
  - The behavior of π-subgroup, Hall subgroup, and core constructions under group homomorphisms (`morphism`), quotient groups, and isomorphisms is fully developed.

• **Maximal π-Subgroups and Uniqueness Results:**
  - The file formalizes maximality in terms of inclusion among π-subgroups, and relates these to Hall subgroups under normality conditions.

Representation and Coding Conventions
=====================================
1. **Type Classes and Canonical Structures:**
   - Most group constructions are parameterized over an explicit finite group type `gT : finGroupType`, and many are properly defined as functions from sets or groups of type `{set gT}` or `{group gT}` to corresponding types.
   - Core operators such as `pcore` and `pseries` are given canonical `{group gT}` instances to support seamless integration into group-theory automation.

2. **Boolean Reflection and Duality:**
   - Predicates (such as being a π-group or a Hall subgroup) are expressed as Boolean-valued functions, following MathComp’s “small scale reflection” methodology. Many theorems are provided in “reflect” form, bridging the computational and logical views.

3. **Notational Layer:**
   - A uniform dot/prime notation is used for π-related concepts:
     - `pi.-group G`  (G is a π-group)
     - `pi.-subgroup(G) H`
     - `pi.-Hall(G) H`
     - `p.-Sylow(G) P`
     - `pi.-elt x`   (x is a π-element)
     - `x._pi`       (π-constituent of x)
     - `'O_pi(G)`    (π-core of G)
     - `'O_{p1,...,pn}(G)` (iterated core/p-series)
   - All notations are in the appropriate MathComp group scope to maximize overloading transparency.

4. **Set- vs Group-Level Definitions:**
   - Notions are defined at the level of sets `{set gT}` for maximum generality, and the group properties (closure under the group operation) are ensured by canonical structures and standard mathematical arguments, not by adding explicit group property checks.

5. **Wildcard and Implicit Arguments:**
   - The file sets `Set Implicit Arguments` and disables unnecessary printing of implicit information, enabling terse but expressive statements.

6. **Separation of Definitions, Properties, and Morphisms:**
   - The file is organized into sections for:
     - Raw definitions (`PgroupDefs`): introduces the central notions for π-groups, subgroups, Hall, Sylow, elements, cores, etc.
     - Properties (`PgroupProps`, `PCoreProps`, etc): elementary and advanced facts about the interplay between these objects.
     - Morphisms (`Morphim`, `MorphPcore`, etc): behavior under group homomorphisms and isomorphisms.
     - Quotients (`Pquotient`): properties of π-constructions under quotient operations.
     - Core series (`PseriesDefs`): iterated core constructions, with associated notations and properties.

7. **Hierarchy and Reuse:**
   - Many facts are proved generically for π (sets of primes), and corresponding statements for p-groups, Hall, or Sylow subgroups follow as specializations.
   - Key results relate the maximality, conjugacy, and normality of π-subgroups and their cores, generalizing classical theorems such as Cauchy's and Hall's theorems in a uniform formal setting.

Usage and Interpretation
========================
This file forms a foundational backbone for machine-checked finite group theory developments that rely on the prime decomposition of group order, such as the study of solvable groups, the classification of finite simple groups, and applications of the Sylow and Hall theorems.

Someone reading this docstring should be able to understand that every definition or lemma in the file is situated within the context of:
  - Finite groups parameterized by an explicit group type,
  - Predicates on group order and element orders with respect to prime sets,
  - A rich interplay between subgroup structure, normality, coprimality, and group actions,
  - A coding style that privileges Boolean predicates and heavily leverages MathComp’s canonical structural machinery.

New code or code comments should consistently follow the conventions outlined here, use the established notations (with the appropriate group scope), and expect familiarity with the reflected predicate and set-theoretic style adopted throughout.

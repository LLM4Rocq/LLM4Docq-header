Algebraically Closed Fields: Quantifier Elimination and Countable Constructions

Overview
========

This file develops a formalization of quantifier elimination (QE) for algebraically closed fields within the Coq proof assistant, using the Mathematical Components (MathComp) library as a technical foundation. Its goal is twofold:

1. **Quantifier Elimination for Algebraically Closed Fields:**  
   The file provides a constructive proof that every first-order formula over an algebraically closed field can be reduced to an equivalent quantifier-free formula. This is achieved via explicit algorithms on polynomial representations and formulas, thus mechanizing a central result from model theory.

2. **Countable Field Extensions and Algebraic Closures:**  
   Using the machinery for quantifier elimination, the file also formalizes the construction of algebraic closures and simple field extensions for countable fields, ensuring that these objects possess the desired algebraic properties in a countable and computable setting.

Mathematical Objects and Their Representations
==============================================

All formalizations proceed in the context of a (possibly countable) field `F`, which is either assumed or constructed to be algebraically closed. The key mathematical structures and concepts include:

- **Fields and Algebraically Closed Fields (`fieldType`, `Field_isAlgClosed`):**  
  - Fields are modeled using MathComp’s typeclass hierarchy.  
  - Algebraically closed fields are characterized not only axiomatically but also by providing evidence (the `solve_monicpoly` axiom) enabling quantifier elimination.

- **Polynomials:**  
  - General polynomials with coefficients in `F` are denoted `{poly F}`;  
  - An alternative syntactic, term-level representation is provided by `polyF`, defined as `seq tF`, where `tF` are (syntactic) terms over the signature of the field.
  - Transformations between semantic and syntactic forms are pivotal for translating between algebraic and logical representations.

- **Terms and Formulas (`tF` and `fF`):**  
  - Terms (`tF`) describe arithmetic expressions possibly involving indeterminates;  
  - Formulas (`fF`) are Boolean combinations of atomic relations over these terms.
  - Evaluations (`eval_poly`, `eval`) interpret terms and polynomials under variable assignments.

- **First-Order Logic and Quantifier Elimination:**  
  - Quantifier-Free formulas are tracked using reflection predicates (`qf`, `qf_form`, `rformula`).
  - Quantifiers are eliminated via constructive procedures that rewrite existential and universal statements over field terms to quantifier-free formulas about polynomials.

- **Continuation-Passing Style (CPS) for Algorithms on Formulas:**  
  - Many algorithmic operations—especially on formulas, polynomials, and their computational decompositions (GCDs, divisions, etc.)—are implemented in CPS (Continuation-Passing Style), providing a uniform and modular interface for formula manipulation with correctness guarantees.
  - The `cps` type alias abstracts the continuation pattern.

- **Polynomial Algorithms (GCD, Division, Modular Decomposition):**  
  - Division and GCD algorithms, both at the semantic and syntactic (term) level, are developed for polynomials represented as sequences of terms.
  - These include iterative implementations for computing remainders, quotients, GCDs, and coprimality, essential for analyzing the roots and structure of polynomials in the model-theoretic arguments.

- **Existential Quantifier Elimination Mechanism:**  
  - Core to the quantifier elimination is the transformation of first-order existential formulas into statements about the existence (or non-existence) of polynomial roots, using resultants and GCD computations (`ex_elim_seq`, `ex_elim`).

- **Countable Extensions and Algebraic Closures:**  
  - The file constructs (via parametricity and encoding) countable field extensions and countable algebraic closures for given countable fields, verifying universality and algebraic closedness via earlier QE results.

Key Notational and Coding Conventions
=====================================

- **Naming and Scoping:**  
  - The file consistently distinguishes between semantic objects (e.g., `{poly F}`) and syntactic, term-level objects (`polyF : seq tF`) for formulas and polynomials.
  - Field terms and formulas (`tF`, `fF`) are systematically used for symbolic computation, while objects in `{poly F}` represent their standard algebraic semantics.

- **Continuation-Passing Style (CPS) Idiom:**  
  - Operations on syntactic polynomials and formula construction follow a CPS discipline notable in functions like `ret`, `bind`, and dedicated CPS versions of algebraic operations (`cpsif`, etc.), allowing quantifier elimination to proceed modularly and with precise control over logical context.

- **Reflection and Well-Foundedness:**  
  - Key reflection predicates (e.g., `qf`, `qf_cps`) ensure that transformations preserve quantifier-freeness and allow dual reasoning in Boolean and propositional forms.
  - Correctness and well-definedness properties are paired with all major CPS algorithms, providing explicit evaluation lemmas connecting syntactic computations with their semantic meaning (`qf_eval`, etc.).

- **Formula Representation for Existential Elimination:**  
  - Existentially quantified formulas are represented as pairs of sequences of polynomials, with their quantifier elimination given by resultants (`rgcdpTs`), GCD-based coprimality procedures (`rgdcopT`), and size tests, all in the term-level (syntactic) framework.

- **Automation and Structural Lemmas:**  
  - The use of MathComp tactics (`Hint Resolve`, lemma naming), local notation, and auxiliary morphisms supports compositional proofs and automation in formula transformation and verification steps.

- **Countability and Encoding:**  
  - In constructing countable algebraic closures, all elements must be built by finite, computable schemes (using dependently typed records with explicit witnesses), and root-finding is realized constructively and algorithmically.

Context for Retrieval and Interpretation
=======================================

This file is a comprehensive formalization of quantifier elimination for algebraically closed fields in Coq, designed to be both constructive and implementable. It provides a library of computational definitions and lemmas that relate syntactic manipulations (on terms and formulas) to semantic truths (about fields and polynomials), with strict tracking of quantifier-freeness, correctness, and computational content. The core design choices—such as the use of CPS and explicit reflection, and the systematic bridging of syntactic and semantic objects—enable fine-grained control for interpreting, modifying, or reusing individual algorithms. Users and automated agents reading this docstring should be able to contextualize isolated code or proof elements as specific components of this overall quantifier elimination pipeline or of the constructive, countable theory of algebraic closures.

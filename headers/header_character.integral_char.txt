Character Rings and Integrality in Finite Group Representation Theory

Overview and Purpose
====================
This file develops theory and standard results at the intersection of the character theory of finite groups and the structure of their group rings, focusing especially on integrality properties of character values and central elements. Its primary aims are to formalize and prove classical theorems involving degrees and values of irreducible characters, as well as to describe the interaction between characters, class sums, and the center of the group ring. Fundamental results include Isaacs' theorem that the degrees of irreducible characters divide the group order; Burnside's p^a.q^b-solvability theorem; and a range of integrality properties concerning character values and central idempotents, all within the formal system of Coq's Mathematical Components (MathComp) library.

Mathematical Structures and Concepts
====================================

This file manipulates and interrelates several key mathematical objects connected to finite groups and their representations:

1. **Finite Groups and Conjugacy Classes**  
   - Finite groups are internally represented as `{group gT}` where `gT : finGroupType`.
   - The set of conjugacy classes is encoded as a finite sequence, with indices `(i : 'I_#|classes G|)` used throughout.

2. **Group Rings and Central Elements**  
   - For a field `F` and group `G`, the group ring `F[G]` is formalized as `group_ring F G`.
   - The center of the group ring, denoted `'Z(group_ring F G)`, consists of those elements of the group ring that commute with all other elements.

3. **Class Sums (Central Elements from Class Functions)**  
   - For each conjugacy class, the sum of all group elements in that class (the class sum) is defined as `'K_k`, called the k-th class sum, instantiated as a matrix via `gset_mx F G (enum_val k)`.
   - These class sums form a basis of the center of the group ring, and multiplication of class sums is a central operation in the file.

4. **Product and Structure Constants for Class Sums**  
   - The product `'K_i *m 'K_j` of class sums is expanded on the basis of class sums:
     - The coefficient of `'K_k` in the product is given by `gring_classM_coef i j k`, which counts certain triples related to the group multiplication of class representatives.
     - The underlying set being counted, `gring_classM_coef_set Ki Kj g`, consists of all pairs `(x, y)` with `x` in class `Ki`, `y` in class `Kj`, and `x*y = g`.

5. **Character Theory and Irreducible Characters**  
   - The irreducible characters of `G` are handled as elements of type `'CF(G)` (complex-valued class functions), with irreducibles indexed as `'chi[G]_i`.
   - The *degree* of an irreducible character is denoted `'chi_i 1%g`.

6. **Character Ring Modes and Eigenvalues**  
   - For an irreducible character `'chi_i`, the map `'omega_i[A]` extracts the eigenvalue associated to a central element `A` of the group ring with respect to the representation corresponding to `'chi_i`.
   - These modes are defined so that for a central element `A`, the action in the irreducible representation decomposes as a scalar multiplication by `'omega_i[A]`.

7. **Integrality and Algebraic Properties**  
   - The file works within algebraic closures and splitting fields as required, introducing field extensions where roots of unity or full set of character values live, with explicit usage of Galois theory where needed.
   - Integrality results establish when certain character values, class sum coefficients, or scalar multiples are algebraic integers.

8. **Solvability and Classical Theorems**  
   - The file proves that groups whose orders have at most two prime divisors are solvable (Burnside), and that the degrees of irreducible characters always divide the group order.
   - Several other classic results on vanishing of nonlinear irreducible character values, minimal degrees, and the structure of centralizers are also formalized.

Key Notational and Coding Conventions
=====================================

- **Indexed Notation:** Many constructions are parametrized by indices over the set of conjugacy classes using `i : 'I_#|classes G|` or over irreducible characters with `i : Iirr G`.
- **Apostrophe-Notation:** 
  - `'K_i` denotes the i-th class sum in the group ring.
  - `'omega_i[A]` denotes the mode/eigenvalue for the irreducible character `i` at the central element `A`.
  - `'chi[G]_i` is the i-th irreducible character of `G`.
- **Shorthand for Structure Constants:** `a i j k` abbreviates `gring_classM_coef i j k`, and is used primarily in sums and expansions.
- **Coq-Specific Types and Scopes:** Implicit arguments and type classes from MathComp are widely used. All group and ring-theoretic operations happen within appropriate local scopes (`ring_scope`, etc.).
- **Matrix Representations and Central Elements:** Matrices are used to encode elements of the group ring and their representations, with central elements treated as matrices that commute with all others.
- **Algebraic Integers and Integrality:** The file uses `Aint` to denote the set of algebraic integers, and demonstrates that various quantities (character values, class sum modes, certain scaled coefficients) lie within this set.
- **Canonical Structures and Unlocking:** For compatibility with MathComp's hierarchy builder, canonical/unlockable definitions are declared for certain abstractions, especially those pertaining to the mode construction for irreducible characters.

Structure and Dependencies
=========================
The file is organized into sections reflecting foundational (generic) facts about class sums and the group ring, results about integral properties of characters, and finally, various deeper theorems about group and character structure (such as Burnside's, Isaacs', and others). Results are often stated in a way that exposes their combinatorial or arithmetic structure, providing not only existence but also explicitness of the quantities involved.

**Dependencies:**  
Numerous MathComp libraries are required, including modules for basic algebra, finite group theory, representation theory, fields and field extensions, commutative algebra, and character theory. Advanced results draw on Galois theory and field arithmetic.

Intended Audience and Usage
==========================
This file is intended for mathematicians, logicians, and formal method practitioners interested in computer-verified treatments of classical representation theory, working over finite groups and their character rings. It provides infrastructure and theorems supporting deeper developments in group theory, character analysis, and algebraic number theory within a machine-checked setting.

It assumes familiarity with the mathematics of finite group representations, but all formalization-related conventions are described within this docstring, making it self-contained for purposes of code navigation, documentation, and further development work.
